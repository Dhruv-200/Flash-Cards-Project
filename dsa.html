            <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Overview</h3>
            <p>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science that deal with the organization and manipulation of data efficiently. Understanding DSA is key for optimizing code performance in any software development.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Structures</h3>
            <p>Data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables define ways to store and organize data for efficient access and modification. Choosing the right data structure is crucial for performance optimization.</p>
            
            <h3>Algorithms</h3>
            <p>Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems. Common types of algorithms include sorting, searching, and graph traversal. Algorithm efficiency is measured in time and space complexity, often expressed using Big O notation.</p>
            
            <h3>Importance in Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>DSA provides the tools to solve computational problems efficiently. Good knowledge of DSA helps in optimizing performance, minimizing memory usage, and reducing the time complexity of operations.</p>
            
            <h3>Applications of DSA</h3>
            <p>DSA is used in various areas, such as web development, machine learning, databases, and system programming. It is essential for competitive programming and interview preparation in software engineering roles.</p>
            
            <h3>Big O Notation</h3>
            <p>Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space. It helps in analyzing the worst-case performance and scalability of algorithms.</p>
