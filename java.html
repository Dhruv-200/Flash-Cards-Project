            <h3>Java Overview</h3>
            <p>Java, developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, is an object-oriented, platform-independent language designed for building cross-platform applications. It is widely used for enterprise applications, mobile apps, and large-scale systems.</p>
            
            <h3>Platform Independence</h3>
            <p>Java’s “Write Once, Run Anywhere” principle allows developers to write code that can run on any device or operating system that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java highly portable.</p>
            
            <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
            <p>Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, enabling developers to design systems using objects, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, promoting code reusability and scalability.</p>
            
            <h3>Automatic Memory Management</h3>
            <p>Java uses automatic memory management through garbage collection, which frees up unused memory. This helps in preventing memory leaks, though developers still need to be aware of memory usage in large-scale applications.</p>
            
            <h3>Concurrency and Multithreading</h3>
            <p>Java has built-in support for multithreading and concurrent programming, allowing developers to build efficient, scalable applications that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>
            
            <h3>Applications and Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>Java is widely used in building enterprise applications, Android mobile development, and web applications. Its rich ecosystem includes frameworks like Spring and Hibernate, which simplify development.</p>
