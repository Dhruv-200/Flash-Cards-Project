            <h3>C Overview</h3>
            <p>C, developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972, is a foundational, general-purpose programming language. Known for its efficiency, it is widely used in system programming, embedded systems, and operating systems, such as Unix.</p>
            
            <h3>Low-Level Access and Efficiency</h3>
            <p>C provides low-level memory access through pointers, making it suitable for systems where performance and hardware interaction are critical. Its ability to directly manipulate memory gives it a speed advantage over higher-level languages.</p>
            
            <h3>Portability</h3>
            <p>One of Câ€™s greatest strengths is its portability. Programs written in C can be compiled and run on various platforms with minimal changes, making it a widely adopted language across different operating systems.</p>
            
            <h3>Memory Management</h3>
            <p>C does not have automatic garbage collection. Developers must manually allocate and deallocate memory using functions like <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code>, which provides control but can lead to issues like memory leaks.</p>

            <h3>Procedural Programming</h3>
            <p>C follows the procedural programming paradigm, breaking down tasks into functions and promoting a structured, modular approach to code development.</p>
            
            <h3>Wide Usage and Legacy</h3>
            <p>Despite being over four decades old, C remains widely used, especially in systems programming and embedded devices. It is also the foundation for many modern languages, including C++, Java, and Python.</p>
