            <h3>C++ Overview</h3>
<p>C++, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985, is an extension of C with object-oriented programming features. It is widely used for software development in applications requiring high performance, such as games, real-time systems, and complex simulations.</p>

<h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
<p>C++ adds object-oriented programming (OOP) features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, which promote code reusability, modularity, and better organization in large projects.</p>

<h3>Low-Level and High-Level Programming</h3>
<p>C++ offers a mix of low-level memory manipulation and high-level abstraction. It retains C's performance capabilities while introducing high-level constructs for easier program design and management.</p>

<h3>Standard Template Library (STL)</h3>
<p>The STL in C++ provides a collection of template classes and functions for common data structures like vectors, lists, and maps, allowing for efficient code reuse and flexibility.</p>

<h3>Memory Management</h3>
<p>C++ allows both manual memory management and automatic features like smart pointers for managing memory more safely. However, developers can still encounter issues with memory leaks if not handled properly.</p>

<h3>Performance and Applications</h3>
<p>C++ is commonly used in performance-critical applications, such as game engines, high-performance computing, and real-time systems. It balances high performance with rich abstractions for large-scale software development.</p>
