            <h3>Python Overview</h3>
            <p>Python, created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, is a high-level, interpreted language known for its readability and simplicity. It is widely used for web development, data science, automation, and scripting.</p>
            
            <h3>Easy Syntax and Readability</h3>
            <p>Python's simple and clean syntax emphasizes readability, making it easy to learn and use. This makes Python a popular choice for beginners as well as for rapid application development.</p>
            
            <h3>Interpreted Language</h3>
            <p>Python is an interpreted language, meaning code is executed line-by-line, which allows for quick testing and debugging. It runs on various platforms, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
            
            <h3>Extensive Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
            <p>Python has a vast standard library and numerous third-party packages, such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow, that extend its capabilities to web development, data analysis, and machine learning.</p>
            
            <h3>Dynamic Typing and Memory Management</h3>
            <p>Python uses dynamic typing and automatic memory management through its garbage collector, which simplifies coding but can have performance overhead compared to statically-typed languages.</p>
            
            <h3>Applications and Versatility</h3>
            <p>Python is used in a wide range of fields, including web development (Django, Flask), data science, automation, and AI. Its versatility and large community support make it a powerful tool for various industries.</p>
